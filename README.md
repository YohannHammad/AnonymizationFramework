# Anonymization Framework
This anonymization framework can be used on your own databases but was initially developed to anonymize databases from the GDA Score project: https://github.com/gda-score. Feel free to look at the different example files.

# Requirements
Our Framework has been developed with ```Python 3```. Make sure you have the right version or download it from https://www.python.org/.
You must also install all the necessary modules with the following command (from the project folder) :
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

# Documentation
The documentation is accessible by executing the following command from the ``docs`` folder :
```bash
python -m http.server <port>
```

Or if ``http.server`` does not exist :
```bash
python -m SimpleHttpServer <port>
```

Then, you can access to the documentation from your favorite web browser at : `http://localhost:<port>`

# Credits

This project is probably far from being perfect so we are open to upgrades.
